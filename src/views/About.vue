        is a curated list of innovative and product-oriented aec companies and startups.
      </p>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Sometime in 2019, Gui Talarico started a list of companies he thought were doing interesting
        things in AEC. As the list grew, he thought it could be of value to others.
        <a href="https://AecStartups.com">AecStartups.com</a>
        was born.
      </p>
      <p>
        As people discovered it, new submissions started coming in, but moderating and formatting
        entries was very time consuming and error prone.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>aec.works</strong>
        was started in 2020 to become the successor of AecStartups and has some noticeable
        improvements:
      </p>
      <ul class="mt-2 mb-2">
        <li class="ml-1">
          <p>• Streamlined tooling to edit content, including non-descructive revisions.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="ml-1">
          <p>• It's more interactive and engaging, with the ability to comment and clap.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="ml-1">
          <p>
            • New and improved entries, totaling more than 160 companies with sleek cover images and
            logos.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="ml-1">
          <p>
            •

      <h2>Content Quality</h2>

      <p>
        We believe the value of
        <strong>aec.works</strong>
        is not only on the platform itself but also in the community of editors and content
        curators.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>aec.works</strong>
        is not intended to be a comprehensive list of AEC companies, but a selected list that
        includes only companies considered interesting and innovative by our editors.
