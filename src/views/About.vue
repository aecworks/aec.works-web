        <strong>aec.works</strong>
        is a curated list of kick-ass product-oriented AEC companies and startups.
      </p>
      <h2 class="mb-1 mt-3">History</h2>
      <p>
        In 2019, I started a small website called AecStartups.com started as a spreadsheet to track
        what he thought were cool new companies springing up around AEC. The project is still live
        at
        <a href="http://aecstartups.com">aecstartups.com</a>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        As the word went around, it started to get contributions from visitors. But the experience
        to view or collaborate was not great, and there was also no way to track/moderate changes to
        improve content over time. It became a time-consuming task to moderate submissions and
        format logos properly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>aec.works</strong>
        started as a redo of AecStartups, with a few changes:
      </p>
      <ul class="tos-list">
        <li class="ml-1">
          <p>
            • It is about
            <strong>all of AEC</strong>
            and not just startups
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="ml-1"><p>• It invites collaboration and has tools to manage content</p></li>
        <li class="ml-1"><p>• It allows for discussion and user contributions</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        After speaking with many people in the field, I got together with a few equally motivated
        people to finalize and build the version you are seeing now.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mb-1 mt-3">Building a community</h2>

      <p>
        I am deeply inspired and grateful for all the communities that spring up around different
        expertise and topics: Maxwell Render Forum, Grasshopper, Sketchup Forum, Stack Overflow,
        Dynamo Forum, GitHub, and Slack Channels like python-aec or Architechie, just to name a few.
        I attribute many of the skills I have acquired over the few years to the knowledge and
        support these communities offer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although these technical forums are great, I believe there is value in bringing people
        across the industry to a single place to exchange content and ideas. Generic social
        platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn are not tailored for AEC, and content gets mixed with
        and diluted by other unrelated topics and industries.
      </p>

      <p>
        Social platforms are ultimately all about the people and the community that forms around
        them. Our goal with aec.works is to stay simple and bring lots of energy and great content
        to everyone.
