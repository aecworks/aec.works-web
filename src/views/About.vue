      <p>
        <strong>aec.works</strong>
        is a curated list of kick-ass product-oriented AEC companies and startups.
      </p>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        In 2019 while working at WeWork, I started a list of companies I thought were doign
        interesting things in AEC.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the list grew, I thought this could be of value to others, so
        <a href="https://AecStartups.com">AecStartups.com</a>
        was born.
      </p>
      <p>
        As people discovered the project, I started receiving contributions from visitors. But the
        experience to view or collaborate was not great, and there was also no way to track/moderate
        changes to improve content over time. It became a time-consuming task to moderate
        submissions and format logos properly.
      </p>
      <!-- <h2>aec.works </h2> -->
      <p>
        <strong>aec.works</strong>
        started is a redo of AecStartups, with a few important improvements:
      </p>
      <ul class="mt-2 mb-2">
        <li class="ml-1">
          <p>
            • It is about
            <strong>all of AEC</strong>
            and, not just startups
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="ml-1"><p>• It's better looking, we think : )</p></li>
        <li class="ml-1">
          <p>
            • It has a user accounts and ability to created and edit without leaving the website
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="ml-1">
          <p>
            • It's more interactive and engaging through commenting, likes, and posts (planned).
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        After speaking with many people in the field, I got together with a few equally motivated
        people to finalize and build the version you are seeing now.

      <h2>Content Quality</h2>

      <p>
        We believe the value of
        <strong>aec.works</strong>
        is not only on the platform itself, but the in community of editors and content curators.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>aec.works</strong>
        is not intended to be a comprehensive list of AEC companies, but a selected list that
        includes only companies considered kick-ass by our editors.
