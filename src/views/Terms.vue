      <p>
        All uses of the AEC Works logo, AEC Works badges, brand slogans, iconography, and the like,
        may only be used with express permission from AEC Works. AEC Works reserves all rights, even
        if certain assets are included in AEC Works open source projects. Please contact

      <h2 class="mb-1 mt-3">Reserved Names</h2>
      <p>
        AEC Works has the right to maintain a list of reserved names which will not be made publicly
        available. These reserved names may be set aside for purposes of proactive trademark
        protection, avoiding user confusion, security measures, or any other reason (or no reason).

        Additionally, AEC Works reserves the right to change any already-claimed name at its sole
        discretion. In such cases, AEC Works will make reasonable effort to find a suitable
        alternative and assist with any transition-related concerns.

      <ul class="tos-list">
        <li class="ml-1">
          <p>
            • Users must make a good-faith effort to share content that is on-topic, of
            high-quality, and is not designed primarily for the purposes of promotion or creating
            backlinks.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="ml-1">
          <p>
            • Posts must contain substantial content — they may not merely reference an external
            link that contains the full post.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="ml-1">
          <p>
            • If a post contains affiliate links, that fact must be clearly disclosed. For instance,
            with language such as: “This post includes affiliate links; I may receive compensation
            if you purchase products or services from the different links provided in this article.”
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        AEC Works reserves the right to remove any content that it deems to be in violation of this
        policy at its sole discretion. Additionally, AEC Works reserves the right to restrict any
